# PDF-merger
Merge two PDFs into one.

## About
- Both files need to be .pdf files and placed at the same directory as the script file.

## Usage
If files are PDFs:
```
python PDF_merger.py <filename 1> <filename 2>
```

If files are SVGs: amend the script to take your SVG filenames then
```
python svg_to_pdf.py
```
